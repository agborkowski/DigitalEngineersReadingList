Digital Engineers' Reading List
===============================

I do a lot of mentoring of PHP Developers, and as part of that, I spend quite a bit of time showing folks where to go to keep up with news and trends with PHP, the wider community, and the web ecosystem in general.  Instead of repeating myself all the time, I thought it would be a sensible thing to maintain a list of my recommendations in one place, to make it easier for everyone to track.

This isn't a definitive list (pull requests on GitHub welcome!), but I hope that you find it a very useful one.

If you know of any resources that the general PHP developer community / ecosystem would probably be interested in, please send me a pull request.

PHP Development
---------------

* [Planet PHP] (http://www.planet-php.net) Feeds: [RSS] ()

    This is your one-stop shop for keeping up with the blogs of individual developers working in PHP today.  Anyone who is doing useful work for the wider PHP community will be on here.  In fact, I'd go as far as saying that anyone who is blogging about PHP but isn't on Planet PHP ... I'd be questioning why not.

Browsers
--------

Major browser news tends to turn up on the general technology blogs, but you really should make the time and effort to go and read the original source material too.  Right now, there are only three browsers that you need to pay attention to:

* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox
* [Internet Explorer] (http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/) Feeds: [RSS] (http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/atom.xml)

Web Design / Frontend Stuff
---------------------------

* [A List Apart] (http://www.alistapart.com) Feeds: [RSS] (http://www.alistapart.com/rss.xml)

Back Office / Server-Side Stuff
-------------------------------

* [Programmable Web] (http://www.programmableweb.com) Feeds: [RSS] (http://feedproxy.google.com/ProgrammableWeb)

LAMP Stack Users
----------------

If you use Linux anywhere in your development, test or production environments, then you must must *must* go out right now and purchase a subscription to [Linux Weekly News] (http://lwn.net). It is the one place to keep up with what is going on in the Linux community, and is worth every single penny.

Once you've subscribed to Linux Weekly News, you might find the following sites to be sources of useful additional information:

* [Freshmeat] (http://freshmeat.net) Feeds: [RSS] (http://freshmeat.net/?format=atom)

Servers, Platforms, Clouds
--------------------------

* [High Scalability] (http://highscalability.com) Feeds: [RSS] (http://highscalability.com/rss.xml)

The Social Web And General Tech News
------------------------------------

The four main technology sources today are (in no particular order):

* [Engadget] (http://engadget.com) Feeds: [RSS] (http://feeds.engadget.com/weblogsinc/engadget)
* [ReadWriteWeb] (http://www.readwriteweb.com) Feeds: [RSS] (http://www.readwriteweb.com/rss.xml)
* [Techcrunch] (http://techcrunch.com/) Feeds: [RSS] (http://techcrunch.com/rssfeeds/)
